# World Simulator

Student project created for OOP course purposes.

This is a simulation of a world with plants, animals and a human. User can move human across the board. Each time the direction in which user wants to move is picked, animals also move and plants will grow.

Reminder: there is a possibility that user can be eaten by an animal. Be careful.
